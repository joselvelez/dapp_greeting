# Simple Ethereum Blockchain Dapp

This is a simple blockchain dapp built to run on the Ethereum blockchain. It will retrieve and set a greeting from the blockchain.

This project follows along the tuturial found [here](https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-ethereum-development-3j13)

I made some slight modifications along the way and included more comments on useful links to documentation. This is for my own reference, but hopefully it will be helpful to others.
